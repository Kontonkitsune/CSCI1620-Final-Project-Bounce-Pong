# CSCI1620-Final-Project: Pong Pong

This is a fork of https://gist.github.com/vinothpandian/4337527. Original code for classic pong can be found there. This project contains a modified version of that code.

This is a variation of Pong where the ball will bounce against the bottom of the screen. There is additionally a barrier in the center which the ball must clear in order to make it to the other side, making it much more similar to actual Ping-Pong.
